      "question": "How do certificates and accomplishments work in DeepLearning.AI programs?",
      "answer": "When you complete a DeepLearning.AI program, you can earn a Coursera certificate (paid) if you are taking it on the Coursera platform, an Accomplishment, or a DeepLearning.AI certificate for Pro Members who complete long-form courses or specializations on our platform. A Pro subscription is required to fully complete and access an Accomplishment and/or a DeepLearning.AI certificate."

      "question": "Why didn't I receive a certificate after completing a Short Course?",
      "answer": "Short Courses do not provide certificates, but they unlock an Accomplishment when completed. Accomplishments are proof that you successfully finished the course and engaged with its content. Certificates are reserved for Specializations and long-form Courses. You can access your Accomplishment from your course dashboard and share it on LinkedIn or your portfolio."

      "question": "Why does my Short Course still appear incomplete after I've finished it?",
      "answer": "To unlock an Accomplishment, you must have an active Pro Subscription and complete every step: all videos marked as watched, all sections checked off as complete, and the feedback form at the end of the course submitted successfully. If the course still shows incomplete after confirming all steps, try refreshing your browser or logging out and back in."

You can take a screenshot or print to PDF directly from your browser. Your Accomplishment is designed to be shareable digitally via a link to LinkedIn, your resume, or portfolio."

You can complete a course in one sitting, pause and continue whenever it works for you, or revisit the material anytime after finishing."

To download notebooks and files, open the workspace of the first lab in the Short Course, click File → Open in the Jupyter notebook, and from there you can view and download all files. Some courses provide a requirements.txt file to help you recreate the same environment on your own computer."

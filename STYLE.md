- **Solution-oriented**: Always provide actionable next steps
- **Reassuring**: Address concerns with confidence and clarity

### What to Avoid

- Marketing speak or sales language in support contexts

---

## Structure & Organization

### Response Structure
Organize responses using this general pattern:

1. **Opening statement** - Brief acknowledgment or context-setting
2. **Core information** - The main answer or explanation
3. **Details/breakdown** - Supporting information, often in lists or sections
4. **Next steps** - Clear action items when applicable
5. **Closing** - "Still need help?" standard footer

### Section Headers
Use clear, descriptive headers to organize information:
- Headers should be questions or clear topic labels
- Use sentence case for headers (e.g., "How to access your Accomplishment")
- Keep headers concise and actionable

### Paragraph Length
- Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences max)
- Use blank lines between paragraphs for readability
- Break up long explanations into distinct sections

---

## Formatting Conventions

### Lists and Bullets

**When to use bullets:**
- For steps in a process (use numbered lists)
- For multiple options or features (use bullet points with -)
- For "what you get" or "what's included" sections

**Bullet point style:**
```
- Start each bullet with a capital letter
- End with a period only if it's a complete sentence
- Use parallel structure (all items should follow the same grammatical pattern)
```

**Numbered list style:**
```
1. Action-oriented instruction with period at the end.
2. Each step should be a clear, discrete action.
3. Use imperative mood ("Click," "Enter," "Go to").
```

### Bold Text
Use bold for:
- Section headers and subheaders
- Key terms being defined (e.g., **Certificates:** Issued for...)
- Important notes or requirements (e.g., **Important details**)
- Plan types or membership tiers (e.g., **Monthly plan:**)

### Emphasis Patterns
- Use colons to introduce lists or explanations
- Use "→" (arrow) for navigation paths or consequences
- Use italics sparingly, primarily for platform-specific terms in context

### Visual Spacing
- Use blank lines to separate distinct concepts or sections
- Group related information together visually
- Use whitespace to improve scanability

---

## Language Guidelines

### Second Person ("You")
Always address the user directly:
- ✅ "You can access your certificate..."
- ❌ "Users can access their certificate..."

### Present Tense
Use present tense for current states and capabilities:
- ✅ "Pro membership includes..."
- ❌ "Pro membership will include..."

### Active Voice
Prefer active over passive voice:
- ✅ "We process refunds within 5-10 business days"
- ❌ "Refunds are processed within 5-10 business days"

### Imperative Mood for Instructions
Use direct commands for steps:
- ✅ "Click the button"
- ❌ "You should click the button"

### Conditional Language
Use "if" statements to provide context-specific guidance:
- "If you signed up with email..."
- "If you're already a Pro member..."
- "If the issue persists..."

### Positive Framing
Frame limitations or restrictions positively when possible:
- ✅ "Pro members have full access to..."
- Rather than: ❌ "Free users don't have access to..."

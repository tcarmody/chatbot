Certificates & Course Completion
Learn how certificates and accomplishments work across DeepLearning.AI courses.

How do certificates and accomplishments work in DeepLearning.AI programs?
When you complete a DeepLearning.AI program, you can earn a Coursera certificate (paid) if you are taking it on the Coursera platform, an Accomplishment, or a DeepLearning.AI certificate for Pro Members who complete long-form courses or specializations on our platform. Please note: A Pro subscription is required to fully complete and access an Accomplishment and/or a DeepLearning.AI certificate.

What do I receive when I finish a Short Course?
DeepLearning.AI’s Short Courses are free and designed to give you hands-on, up-to-date skills in specific AI topics. While they don’t offer official certificates, every learner who completes a Short Course receives an Accomplishment.

Browse all Short Courses.

What you get: An Accomplishment, which is a recognition of completion visible in your DeepLearning.AI account.

How to access:

Go to your DeepLearning.AI dashboard.
Open the completed course.
Click View Accomplishment.



How to share: Learners often screenshot the Accomplishment and:

Add it to the Licenses & Certifications section of their LinkedIn profile.
Post it directly to their feed as proof of learning.
Accomplishments are not official certificates, but they are a great way to highlight your skills and commitment to continuous learning.

What do I receive when I finish a Course or Specialization?
DeepLearning.AI’s longer programs, such as Courses and Specializations, can be completed either on Coursera or through DeepLearning.AI Membership.

Browse all courses and specializations.
If you take them on Coursera:
You pay the course or specialization fee and receive an official Coursera Certificate.
Each course or specialization must be purchased individually through Coursera. The exact price varies depending on the program and is always displayed on the course or specialization page.
To check the current price, visit the course page directly on Coursera before enrolling.
If you take them as a DeepLearning.AI Member:
Members can complete the same courses directly on our platform and receive a DeepLearning.AI Certificate of Completion.
Free users can still access the content but do not have access to certificates.
What you get:
Coursera learners: An official Coursera Certificate (PDF format).
Members: A DeepLearning.AI Certificate of Completion, issued directly by DeepLearning.AI.
Free users: Access to course content. No certificate is issued.
How to access:

Complete all required assignments and quizzes in Coursera.
Download your certificate from the course dashboard.
Share directly to LinkedIn with Coursera’s integration, or add to your resume.

Certificates for these programs are issued either by Coursera or by DeepLearning.AI, depending on where the course is hosted.
If the course is taken on Coursera, certificates are managed by Coursera, for payment, refund, or billing questions, please contact Coursera Support.
If the course is taken on the DeepLearning.AI platform, certificates are managed by DeepLearning.AI, for any certificate-related issues, please create a support ticket here.
How to share your certificate or accomplishment
Certificates → Add them to the Licenses & Certifications section on your LinkedIn profile, either manually or using the “Add to LinkedIn” link available on your certificate.
Accomplishments → Best shared as a screenshot, either as a post or uploaded manually under Licenses & Certifications.

Why didn’t I receive a certificate after completing a Short Course?
Completing a Short Course is an important milestone, and it’s natural to expect recognition for your efforts. This article explains why Short Courses do not provide certificates, what you receive instead, and how you can showcase your learning achievements.

Certificates vs. Accomplishments
Certificates: Issued for Specializations and long-form Courses, either through Coursera or directly by DeepLearning.AI (for Members). They formally recognize the completion of an in-depth learning program. Certificates are only available once the user has an active subscription after the trial period. You can find the complete list of certificate-granting programs here.
Accomplishments: Short Courses (for example, ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers) unlock an Accomplishment when completed. While not a certificate, the Accomplishment is proof that you successfully finished the course and engaged with its content. Accomplishments are only available once the user has an active subscription after the trial period.

How to access your Accomplishment
Log in to the DeepLearning.AI Learning Platform.
Go to your course dashboard.
Click View Accomplishment to open your record.


From there, you can copy the shareable link to post online or include in applications.

How to showcase your learning
Even though Short Courses do not issue certificates, you can still highlight your accomplishment in professional settings:

LinkedIn profile: Add the Accomplishment under the Certifications section with the shareable link.
Social media posts: Share a screenshot of your Accomplishment to celebrate your progress publicly.
Personal portfolio: Include the link in your résumé, website, or project portfolio to demonstrate your skills in AI.

Why the difference?
Short Courses are designed to be fast, practical introductions to the latest AI tools and techniques. They allow learners to quickly upskill and apply new knowledge. Certificates, on the other hand, are reserved for longer programs that provide deeper foundations, multiple modules, and assessments.

Why does my Short Course still appear incomplete after I’ve finished it?
Sometimes learners complete all lessons but still see their Short Course marked as incomplete. This article explains why that happens and how to make sure your Accomplishment is unlocked.

Requirements for completion
To unlock an Accomplishment, you must have an active Pro Subscription to fully complete and access it . Make sure you've completed every step of the course:
All videos are marked as watched.
All sections are checked off as complete.
The feedback form at the end of the course is submitted successfully.

If any of these are incomplete, the system will not register the course as finished.

How to confirm your progress
Open your course dashboard.
Review each section to confirm it shows as completed.
Double-check that you clicked Submit on the feedback form.

Once all steps are complete, your Accomplishment will unlock automatically.

If the course still shows incomplete
Try refreshing your browser or logging out and back in.
If progress still doesn’t update, take a screenshot of your dashboard and contact our Support team.
Why completion tracking matters
Our system uses these checkpoints to ensure that learners fully engage with the course before issuing an Accomplishment. This helps keep the record of completion accurate and reliable.

Still need help?
If you have more questions or encounter any issues, please create a support ticket here. Our team will review your request and get back to you as soon as possible.

Can I download a PDF version of my Short Course Accomplishment?
Many learners want a formal document they can download or share after completing a Short Course. This article explains the current options for saving or showcasing your Accomplishment.

Is there a PDF option?
At this time, Short Course Accomplishments do not include a downloadable PDF. The record of your completion is available online through your Accomplishment page.

How to save your Accomplishment
Even though there isn’t a built-in PDF, you can:

Take a screenshot of your Accomplishment page.
Print to PDF directly from your browser to generate a simple file copy.

How to share your Accomplishment
Your Accomplishment is designed to be shareable digitally:

Add it to the Certifications section of your LinkedIn profile using the shareable link.
Post a screenshot or link as a LinkedIn update to celebrate your achievement.
Include the link in your résumé, portfolio, or website to highlight your skills.

Why there’s no PDF
Short Courses are designed to be lightweight and fast to complete. The Accomplishment system focuses on digital recognition and sharing rather than downloadable documents.

How long will it take me to complete a Short Course?
Short Courses are built to give you practical AI knowledge in a short amount of time. Here’s what you can expect when you take one.

Quick to complete
Most Short Courses take about 1 to 2 hours. This makes it possible to:
Learn a new concept or tool in a single session.
Fit learning into a busy schedule without a long-term commitment.
Make steady progress by completing several Short Courses over time.

Always up to date
AI moves fast, and so do Short Courses. Their compact format allows us to release new ones frequently, so you always find content that reflects the latest tools, practices, and breakthroughs in the field.

Practical and focused
Each course targets a specific skill or concept, giving you hands-on knowledge you can apply right away. There’s no filler — just the essentials you need to understand and use the technology.

Flexible for your schedule
Even though Short Courses are quick, you set the pace:
Complete a course in one sitting.
Pause and continue whenever it works for you.
Revisit the material anytime after finishing.

With Short Courses, you can learn efficiently, stay current with AI, and keep control of your own learning rhythm. They’re designed to deliver maximum value in minimum time.

Why are quizzes or assignments locked in my course?
If you notice that quizzes, assignments, or certain sections of your course are locked, this is usually expected. These features are available only to Pro members.

Why some content is locked
Learners on the free plan have access to course videos and materials, but advanced features like quizzes and graded assignments are restricted. These assessments are reserved for Pro members to support deeper learning and provide a more hands-on experience.

How to unlock restricted content
If you’d like to access quizzes and assignments, you’ll need to upgrade to Pro:

Visit the Pro membership page to review subscription options.
Upgrade your account to Pro.
Log out and back in to refresh your access.

Once upgraded, the locked content should become available immediately.

If you are already a Pro member
If you’ve upgraded to Pro but still see quizzes or assignments locked, this may be a technical issue. In this case:

Please create a support ticket here.
Our team will review your account details and resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

Why this system is in place
Quizzes and assignments are essential for applying knowledge, validating progress, and ensuring skill mastery. By making them part of Pro membership, we can continue expanding our library of hands-on exercises and exclusive learning opportunities.

Can I access Short Course code and resources outside of the platform?
Learners often want to know how much of the Short Course material they can use outside the DeepLearning.AI platform. Here’s what’s possible:

API keys
The API keys used within Short Courses are confidential and are not shared. If you’d like to run notebooks on your own, you’ll need to use your own API keys.

GitHub repositories
DeepLearning.AI does not publicly share its Short Course GitHub repositories.

Running notebooks outside the platform
If you want to download the notebooks and other relevant files from your learning workspace:
Open the workspace of the first lab in the Short Course.
In the Jupyter notebook, click File → Open… in the top menu.
From there, you can view and download all the files.

Along with the notebooks, some courses also provide a requirements.txt file. This lists all the necessary package names and versions, so you can recreate the same environment on your own computer.

This setup allows you to continue experimenting and practicing outside the platform, while keeping the Short Course environment consistent and easy to reproduce.

Efficient Learning Tips
The following tips can help you have an efficient learning experience with this short course and other courses.
Create a Dedicated Study Space: Establish a quiet, organized workspace free from distractions. A dedicated learning environment can significantly improve concentration and overall learning efficiency.
Develop a Consistent Learning Schedule: Consistency is key to learning. Set out specific times in your day for study and make it a routine. Consistent study times help build a habit and improve information retention.
Tip: Set a recurring event and reminder in your calendar, with clear action items, to get regular notifications about your study plans and goals.
Take Regular Breaks: Include short breaks in your study sessions. The Pomodoro Technique, which involves studying for 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break, can be particularly effective.
Engage with the Community: Participate in forums, discussions, and group activities. Engaging with peers can provide additional insights, create a sense of community, and make learning more enjoyable.
Practice Active Learning: Don't just read or run notebooks or watch the material. Engage actively by taking notes, summarizing what you learn, teaching the concept to someone else, or applying the knowledge in your practical projects.

However, if you believe you were charged incorrectly or canceled during your trial but were still billed, please create a support ticket. Our Support team will review your case and, if eligible, issue a full refund. Refunds typically take 5–10 business days to process, depending on your bank.

Will I lose my certificates or progress if I go back to Free?
No. If you cancel your Pro membership and return to the Free plan, all certificates you earned and your course progress will remain linked to your account.

You will still be able to:

View and download certificates earned during your Pro access
See your course progress and which modules you've completed
Resume watching course videos (videos remain free to access)

What changes when your Pro plan ends
Your access to Pro features will remain active until the end of your current billing cycle. After that:

You will no longer have access to Pro-only features (quizzes, labs, certificates for all courses).
Your account will automatically switch to Free at the end of your billing cycle.
Your progress will be saved for up to 180 days, and you can pick up where you left off if you upgrade again during that period.
You won’t be charged again unless you choose to re-upgrade

Why this matters
You can explore and learn freely with Pro, knowing that your progress won’t be lost if you downgrade later. And if you decide to return to Pro in the future, you can pick up right where you left off.

Why don’t I see certain courses in my DeepLearning.AI Pro membership?
If you joined Pro but don’t see access to a course or specialization you expected, this article explains why.

Pro membership coverage
Pro membership includes a wide range of DeepLearning.AI courses and short courses.
However, some new or specialized programs may not yet be available under Pro.

Why some courses aren’t included yet
We’re continuously adding more content to Pro. Occasionally, newly launched programs or certain partner specializations take extra time before being included.

What you can do
If the course you want isn’t included in Pro, you may consider exploring other available Pro courses in the meantime.
If the program is offered on Coursera (like a Specialization or full-length course), you can still take it there. Keep in mind that Coursera charges a separate fee if you’d like to earn a certificate.

Once upgraded, you’ll have immediate access to the new tier’s benefits.

How is the DeepLearning.AI Pro membership different from other learning platforms?
Most online education falls into two categories: university-style courses that focus heavily on theory, or short tutorials that skip the fundamentals. Pro membership offers both — so you’ll gain the foundational knowledge and the practical skills to be successful in building with AI.

Can I join the DeepLearning.AI Pro membership if I’m new to programming?
Yes. You can join the Pro membership even if you’ve never written a line of code before. The program is designed to support both beginners and experienced learners, with a clear path that takes you from the basics to building real AI projects.

How the Pro membership supports beginners
Start from zero: You don’t need prior programming knowledge. The learning journey is structured so you can begin with the fundamentals.

Grow at your own pace: You decide how quickly to move from beginner-friendly courses into more advanced AI tools and applications.
Community guidance: You’ll be learning alongside a global network of learners, many of whom are also starting their journey.

I don’t know how to code. Can I still learn to build with AI?
Absolutely. You don’t need any coding background to start building with AI. Our AI Python for Beginners course has helped over 230,000 people learn to code from scratch using AI as their tutor. You’ll get real-time help when you’re stuck, just like how professional developers work today.

We offer learning paths for every level. If you’re new to AI, you’ll start with simple concepts and gradually build up to creating your own AI tools.

Courses that make it easier to begin
If you’re completely new, some courses included in Pro are perfect entry points:

AI Python for Beginners teaches you coding from scratch, with an AI tutor guiding you in real time.
AI for Everyone and Generative AI for Everyone require no coding at all and have already helped millions of people worldwide understand AI concepts and applications. They’re a great way to get comfortable with AI before deciding if you want to learn to build with it.

Why it works
Thousands of learners join Pro as complete beginners and soon build AI-powered applications. With structured learning, practical exercises, and continuous support, the membership helps you grow into an AI Builder regardless of your starting point.

How much time do I need to commit each week with the DeepLearning.AI Pro membership?

Flexible learning
Self-paced: Move through the material at your own speed.
Modular design: Courses are broken into manageable lessons, making it easy to fit learning into your schedule.
Catch up anytime: If you’re busier some weeks, you can take a break and return later without losing your progress.

Typical time commitment
Most learners spend 3–5 hours per week on coursework. This steady pace helps you stay engaged and continue making progress without needing to cram.

Why consistency matters
Regular, small steps are more effective than long, occasional sessions. With Pro membership, the focus is on consistent learning that builds lasting skills over time.
